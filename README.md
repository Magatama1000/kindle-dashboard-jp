# Kindle Weather Dashboard (for PaperWhite 7th Gen)

Hey there! üëã This is a fun little project I put together to display weather info on my Kindle. It's specifically built to work with Environment Canada's weather data (because their API is free and pretty decent!).

This is the server that I'm using for the Kindle Dashboard specified in this blog post: 
[Reviving my Kindle PW7](https://terminalbytes.com/reviving-kindle-paperwhite-7th-gen/)

*üëÜ This is how it looks on my Kindle! (Rotated 90¬∞ for Kindle display)*

## What's This All About?

This dashboard generates a clean, Kindle-friendly weather display that shows:
- Current temperature and conditions
- Feels like temperature
- Wind speed and humidity
- Air Quality Health Index (AQHI)
- Hourly forecast
- Daily forecast (day/night split)
- Battery level of your Kindle
- Weather alerts (when active)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status

Look, this is a pretty rough project that I hacked together for my own use. It works for me, but there might be bugs, and the code could definitely use some cleanup. That said, if you're in Canada and want to build your own Kindle weather display, this could be a good starting point!

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Web Framework**: Express
- **Image Processing**: 
  - Playwright (for capturing the HTML dashboard)
  - Sharp (for image processing and Kindle-friendly conversion)
- **Weather Data**: Environment Canada API (not sure if you're allowed to use it for this purpose, so use at your own risk)
- **Icons**: Lucide icons (for consistent, clean weather icons)
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

## üé® Cool Features

- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is built with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Text automatically scales based on content length
- **Kindle Optimization**: Images are converted to B&W and rotated for Kindle display
- **Icon Mapping**: Includes a comprehensive mapping of Environment Canada weather codes to Lucide icons
- **Battery Display**: Shows your Kindle's battery level with appropriate icons

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- A thirst for weather data üå§Ô∏è

### Quick Start

1. Grab the code:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:terminalbytes/kindle-dashboard.git
cd kindle-dashboard
```
2. Modify the location LAT/LONG in the `api-weather.ts` file.
3. Fire it up:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
- Build the Docker image
- Start the weather service
- Make it available on port 8080

### Generating Weather Dashboards

To generate a new dashboard (and update battery level):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/battery/75  # Change 75 to your actual battery percentage
```

Your fresh dashboard will be available at:
```
http://localhost:8080/dash.png
```

## üîß Development Notes

### Weather Icons & Conditions

There's a handy script (`icon-codes.ts`) that helps map Environment Canada's weather icon codes to their conditions. It parses API responses to build a comprehensive mapping, which is super useful if you want to add new icon mappings or understand what each code means.

### API Implementation

The main weather dashboard generation happens in `api-weather.ts`. It:
1. Fetches weather data from Environment Canada
2. Maps their icon codes to Lucide icons
3. Generates a responsive HTML dashboard
4. Uses Playwright to capture it as an image
5. Processes the image with Sharp to make it Kindle-friendly

### Local Development

If you want to hack on it locally:

```bash
docker build -t kindle-dashboard .
docker run -p 8080:8080 kindle-dashboard
```

## üìù Configuration

- Default location is set to Medicine Hat, Alberta (modify `WEATHER_LOCATION` in `api-weather.ts` to change)
- Images are saved in the `public` directory
- Runs on port 8080 by default
- Dashboard dimensions are optimized for Kindle (1448x1072)
